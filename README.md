## Description

Enforce software architecture guidelines for your Laravel packages.

Apply DDD, CLEAN and SOLID guidelines (opinionated) for enforcing rules for creating standardized and quality code across any Laravey project or package. You can also apply code smells and common performance checks.

## Installation

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/opscale-co/strict-rules.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/opscale-co/strict-rules)

You can install the package in to a Laravel project via composer:

```bash

composer require opscale-co/strict-rules --dev

```

Next up, you must create a `phpstan.neon` file in the root of your project with this content:

```

includes:
    - vendor/nunomaduro/larastan/extension.neon
    - vendor/opscale-co/strict-rules/rules.clean.neon
    - vendor/opscale-co/strict-rules/rules.ddd.neon
    - vendor/opscale-co/strict-rules/rules.smells.neon
    - vendor/opscale-co/strict-rules/rules.solid.neon
parameters:
    level: 8
    phpVersion: 80200
    paths:
        - src

```

You are free to use only a subset of rules commenting the not needed guidelines.

## Usage

You can run the command vendor/bin/phpstan analyze to execute the rules.

## Testing

``` bash

npm run test

```
