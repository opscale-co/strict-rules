# DDD Assumptions

This document outlines the key assumptions behind our application of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles within a Laravel-based architecture.

## 1. Leveraging Laravel

The main objective of DDD is to model the business domain as software objects. While DDD advocates for complete independence from frameworks, we have made intentional trade-offs by leveraging Laravelâ€™s structure while maintaining the conceptual integrity of DDD.

This allows us to:

- Avoid over-engineering while still modeling the domain faithfully.
- Use Laravel's powerful tools to streamline development.
- Preserve domain intent without fragmenting the system.

The goal is not to build an over-architected solution, but to apply domain modeling effectively within a pragmatic Laravel environment.

## 2. Encouraging the Use of Packages

To simplify the application of domain rules and avoid a single monolithic domain, we enforce a division of logic into subdomains. This is achieved through modularization using packages.

Each subdomain is implemented as an independent package that:

- Handles a specific and concrete business responsibility.
- Encourages clear separation of concerns.
- Supports high decoupling and low coupling between modules.
- Simplifies the flow of logic by keeping each domain small and focused.

By structuring subdomains as standalone packages, we foster maintainability, scalability, and domain clarity across the project.

These assumptions guide our DDD practice: domain-centric design with Laravel pragmatism, and business-driven modularization for clean, evolving systems.
