# A Business-Centric Software Design Methodology

One of the most common mistakes in software development is modeling systems without a profound understanding of the business. Developers often focus on UI flows, framework specifics, or database schemas **without ever modeling how the business actually works**.

Now, with AI permeating every software stack, thereâ€™s a new demand: your system must be **understandable by machines** and **completely governed by logic rules**. That means data must be meaningful, rules must be explicit, and logic must be separate from glue code.

How to accomplish this? Let's see.

## Step 1: Identify Business Units

This is basically identify the subdomains. For example, in an e-commerce context:

- **Inventory** tracks how many products are available and handles restocking.
- **Catalog** manages how products are described and priced.
- **Delivery** calculates logistics costs and routes.
- **Orders** connect everything, acting as the bridge between the islands.

These subdomains **can function independently**, but they communicate via **domain events** (e.g., `OrderPlaced`, `StockDepleted`, `DeliveryStarted`). Understanding **what connects them**â€”typically eventsâ€”is just as important as identifying the units themselves.

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Define clear business boundaries and how they interact.*

---

## Step 2: Map the Information Flow

For each subdomain:

- Identify the **actors** (users, systems).
- Describe the **steps**, inputs, decisions, and outputs.
- Use **BPMN diagrams** to model this flow visually.
- Validate it with the **head of the business unit**.

Avoid modeling *every edge case*. Focus on **meaningful flows** that generate business value.

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Create a shared understanding of what happens, and when.*

## Step 3: Model the Data Architecture

For each subdomain:

1. **Define Entities**: Identify the nouns the business cares about (e.g., Product, Order, Delivery).
2. **Define Relationships**: How do these entities connect?
3. **Define Attributes**: Use **descriptive names** and avoid software-centric fields (`is_visible`, `ui_style_class`).

Use **DBML** to visually represent the model, and maintain a **data dictionary** per entity. This gives LLMs and your team the **semantic clarity** needed for automation and reasoning.

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Build a data model that reflects the real world, not the UI, configuration, etc.*

## Step 4: Define Business Rules

Document and classify them into three levels:

| Level             | Rule Example                                               | Scope       |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Attribute-Level   | `price >= 10`                                                    | Relation for specific values or limits       |
| Entity-Level      | `discount â‰¤ 20% of total`             | Relation between attributes in the same entity    |
| Subdomain-Level   | `An order cannot be canceled if delivery is in progress`       | Relation between entities in the same subdomain     |

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Declare rules clearly. Place them where their dependencies are visible and manageable.*

## Step 5: Capture Business Logic

Understand what creates value and why. Here is the secret sauce of a business.

Ask:
- What raw data enters the system?
- What process transforms it?
- What new insight/value does it produce?

It might be:
- A set of business rules.
- A complex formula to get a value.
- A chain on tasks in a specific order.

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Identify and model the transformations that generate value.*

## Step 6: Deliver Meaningful Outcomes

This step is about **choosing the right delivery mechanism**:

- Should this go to a **dashboard**, an **email**, a **Slack alert**, or be stored in a **report**?
- Who consumes it? What **action** does it trigger?
- Whatâ€™s the **best channel**, frequency, and format?

Examples:
- Price predictions â†’ Internal dashboard with comparisons.
- Delivery delays â†’ SMS alerts with tracking links.
- Operational earnings â†’ Weekly PDF with visual insights.

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Maximize the perception and actionability of your information.*

## Step 7: Make It AI-Friendly

Hereâ€™s how:

- Clear separation between **CRUD and logic** allows AI to assist in intelligent decisions.
- Well-defined **business rules** serve as **guardrails**.
- Descriptive **data models with dictionaries** give context-rich prompts for LLMs.

ðŸ’¡ *AI is not magic. Itâ€™s context-hungry and logic-impaired. You need to feed it structured truth.*

Examples:
- LLMs can suggest discounts based on customer contextâ€”because your domain exposes `total_spent_last_30_days`.
- Agents can process refunds if `delivery_status == returned`â€”because your rules make this unambiguous.

ðŸ’¡ *Goal: Make your domain models, rules, and data legible for humans *and* machines.*
