# Clean Assumptions

This document describes the core assumptions and design patterns used in our Laravel project, following Clean Architecture principles. It defines the structure, layers, communication flow, and logic organization to ensure clarity, modularity, and maintainability.

## 1. Project Structure

The folder structure follows a layered and modular design, where each component has a clear responsibility:

```
app|src/
â”œâ”€â”€ 1 Console/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1.1 Commands/
â”œâ”€â”€ 2 Contracts/
â”œâ”€â”€ 3 Events/
â”œâ”€â”€ 4 Exceptions/
â”œâ”€â”€ 5 Http/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 5.1 Controllers/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 3.1.1 API/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 5.2 Middleware/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 5.3 Requests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 5.4 Resources/
â”œâ”€â”€ 6 Jobs/
â”œâ”€â”€ 7 Listeners/
â”œâ”€â”€ 8 Models/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 8.1 Enums/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 8.2 Repositories/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 8.3 ValueObjects/
â”œâ”€â”€ 9 Notifications/
â”œâ”€â”€ 10 Nova/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.1 Actions/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.2 Cards/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.3 Dashboards/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.4 Fields/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.5 Filters/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.6 Lenses/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.7 Menus/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 10.8 Metrics/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 10.9 Repeaters/
â”œâ”€â”€ 11 Observers/
â”œâ”€â”€ 12 Policies/
â””â”€â”€ 13 Providers/
â””â”€â”€ 14 Services/
    â””â”€â”€ 14.1 Actions/ -> Laravel Actions
```

## 2. Project Layers

Each layer is responsible for a different type of logic and data handling:

| Layer          | Role                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Representation | Models â€“ Represent domain entities                         |
| Communication  | Observers â€“ Notify and react to model changes              |
| Transformation | Services, Exceptions â€“ Apply business rules, handle errors |
| Orchestration  | Jobs, Notifications â€“ Coordinate processes and flows       |
| Interaction    | Console, Http, Nova, Policies â€“ User/system interfaces     |

---

## 3. Layers Communication

- **Downward Communication**: Follows dependency injection; upper layers depend on abstractions of the lower ones.
- **Upward Communication**: Happens via Events and Listeners; a layer emits an event, and one or more listeners react independently.

This ensures loose coupling, clear data flow, and high testability.

---

## 4. Logic Handling

### Laravel Actions in Services

We adopt [Laravel Actions](https://github.com/lorisleiva/laravel-actions) inside the `Services/Actions` folder. Each Action represents a use case, encapsulating a single unit of business logic. Use cases commonly need to be called from diferrent layers, in most cases you need to create an element to wrap this call. We can simplify this using Laravel Actions and avoid creating wrappers, you actions can be used as:

- Controllers
- Commands
- Jobs
- Listeners

This design promotes separation of concerns and avoids embedding business logic directly in framework components. Each layer remains focused on its role:

The objective of using Actions in this flexible way is to facilitate **upward communication** and prevent unnecessary wrapping or duplication of logic within these components.

This approach results in reusable, isolated, and testable units of logic.

## 5. Managed Clean Architecture Layers

This section provides an index of all Clean Architecture layers implemented in this project, with their specific responsibilities:

### ðŸ“‹ Index

| Concept | Purpose | Rules |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| **[Representation](./Representation/documentation.md)** | Foundation layer defining what things are, not what they do | `RepresentationLayerRule` |
| **[Communication](./Communication/documentation.md)** | Event-based notification system for domain changes | `CommunicationLayerRule` |
| **[Transformation](./Transformation/documentation.md)** | Core business logic and domain rules application | `TransformationLayerRule` |
| **[Orchestration](./Orchestration/documentation.md)** | Workflow coordination and asynchronous operations | `OrchestrationLayerRule` |
| **[Interaction](./Interaction/documentation.md)** | External interfaces and user/system entry points | `InteractionLayerRule` |
