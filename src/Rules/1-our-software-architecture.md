# What is Software Architecture

The main goal of software architecture is to create a scalable, robust, and clean foundation for building software that mirrors the business. A well-architected system is efficient, testable, and easy to maintain, ensuring long-term success and adaptability.

## Scalable: Think in your client (Business)
Scalability is directly linked to business growth. When does software need to scale? When the business scales. More users, more sales, more processes, a more complex value proposition—all of these require a scalable foundation.

A common mistake in software design is focusing solely on modeling the software itself rather than the business model. Developers often get blinded by technical specifications and assumptions instead of understanding how the business operates. The right approach? Deeply understand the business first, then model it in a way that ensures the software scales naturally as the business grows. With a solid foundation, scaling is simply about adding more capabilities on top of strong pillars.

## Robust: Think in the end-user (Product)
A wise developer prioritizes the end-user experience. It’s not just about building a functional process but ensuring that it performs reliably under all circumstances. Ask yourself:

- What if the process takes longer than expected?
- What if memory leaks crash the browser?
- What if the system goes down at a critical moment (e.g., the last day of the month for a financial institution)?

These situations can be prevented through efficiency and foresight. We sent humans to the moon with just 64KB of RAM, yet today, with 16GB of RAM in average computers, efficiency is often overlooked. Efficient software minimizes processing time, reduces resource consumption, and eliminates unnecessary complexity. Efficiency is not just optimization—it’s about preventing costly failures.

## Clean: Think in your team (Software)
Every developer has inherited a legacy project and thought, _I have no idea what’s going on here_. Software is a living entity—it evolves constantly. But if its architecture is messy, maintenance becomes a nightmare.

Spaghetti code happens when there is no clear communication flow between software components. This usually happens for two reasons:

1. The system was not designed based on business processes, so constant patching led to unmanageable complexity.
2. Even with a clear business understanding, there was no structured approach to managing the flow of information.

To prevent this, clean architecture ensures structured communication, predictable flows, and maintainability. We should always write code with future developers in mind.

## Being an Architect Means Thinking Beyond Code
Great architecture is not just about technology—it’s about perspective. It requires thinking from the standpoint of business stakeholder, end-users, and fellow developers, ensuring that software remains scalable, robust, and clean over time.

A great software architect understands:

- Business growth strategies and how software aligns with them.
- End-user needs, behaviors and expectations.
- Development best practices that create maintainable, adaptable systems.

Software architecture is the foundation of long-lasting, high-impact digital products. By designing systems that scale with the business, deliver reliable performance, and remain clean for future iterations, we ensure that technology supports—not hinders—growth.

## Design Patterns
To ensure our architecture is structured and efficient, we follow key design principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: For modeling the business. This allows us to align our software model with the business model, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
- **SOLID Principles**: For creating efficient software. These guidelines help in making the codebase flexible, maintainable, and robust.
- **CLEAN Architecture**: For communicating components correctly. This enforces clear separation of concerns and ensures our systems remain modular and easy to understand.
