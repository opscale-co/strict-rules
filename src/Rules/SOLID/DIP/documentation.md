# SOLID Principle: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> **High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.**

---

## ðŸ§  What It Means

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) promotes decoupling. High-level components (like controllers, services, or use cases) should not depend directly on concrete implementations of other services or infrastructure. Instead, they should rely on **interfaces or contracts**, which can be swapped or mocked without rewriting logic.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Considerations

Laravel supports dependency injection out of the box, even with concrete classes. For example, it's common (and acceptable) to inject framework services like `Request`, `Response`, or `Log` directly.

**However**, in the **transformation layer** (typically your `App\Services`), it's best to depend on **interfaces only**. This ensures that:

- Your core logic can be tested in isolation
- Implementations can be swapped freely
- You're not tightly coupled to specific service classes

This approach enforces **interface-based dependency injection** specifically in the **transformation layer**. In controllers, middlewares, jobs, and other layers, using concrete classes from the framework is acceptable.

## ðŸ§µ A Data Story Example: Service Coupling

Imagine we have a `CheckoutService` that calls a concrete `PaymentService` directly:

```php
class CheckoutService {
    public function __construct(
        private PaymentService $payment
    ) {}

    public function checkout(Order $order): void {
        $this->payment->charge($order);
    }
}
```

This tightly couples `CheckoutService` to a specific payment implementation.

If later we want to switch to `StripePaymentService` or `FakePaymentService` for testing, we would need to modify this service.

The right way? Extract an interface and rely on it:

```php
interface PaymentInterface {
    public function charge(Order $order): void;
}

class PaymentService implements PaymentInterface {
    public function charge(Order $order): void {
        // Real payment logic
    }
}
```

Update the `CheckoutService`:

```php
class CheckoutService {
    public function __construct(
        private PaymentInterface $payment
    ) {}

    public function checkout(Order $order): void {
        $this->payment->charge($order);
    }
}
```

Register the implementation in a service provider:

```php
public function register(): void {
    $this->app->bind(PaymentInterface::class, PaymentService::class);
}
```

Now `CheckoutService` is **decoupled from the implementation**, and we can inject a mock, a fake, or a third-party payment provider without modifying the service logic.

## ðŸš© Code Smell

> Injecting or instantiating concrete classes instead of interfaces in your service constructors.

This couples your services directly and makes swapping or testing implementations harder.

## ðŸ§ª AST Rules

### ðŸ“Œ `DisallowInstantiationRule`

- **Purpose:** Enforce DIP by disallowing direct instantiation of classes inside business logic.
- **Description:** Flags the use of `new ClassName()` in high-level modules.
- **Justification:** Promotes inversion of dependencies and enables flexible and testable code.

| Property     | Value                      |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| Rule Name    | `DisallowInstantiationRule`|
| Scope        | Constructor/method-level   |
| Condition    | Disallow `new ClassName()` |
