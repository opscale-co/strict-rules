# A Data Story

Imagine an online store that sells only one kind of product: influencer merch. T-shirts, mugs, hats, all designed or endorsed by your favorite creators. The secret to the business? The influencers themselves promote the products during live sessions—through social selling on platforms like Instagram or TikTok Live. Their audience doesn’t browse a full catalog—they see a single product being hyped in real time, and they want that one thing, right now.

Because of that, this isn’t your usual e-commerce setup.

Let’s walk through the story.

## Step 1: Representation – Onboarding Influencers
An influencer signs up and creates a profile. They define which products they want to sell, what styles and prices they prefer. This part of the process is simple: we capture data exactly as entered—nothing fancy. But this data is important. It’s part of the business domain, meaning it reflects the reality of our business model. We’ll use it later to represent influencers and their products in catalogs and dashboards.

No processing, no logic—just raw data that matters.

## Step 2: Interaction – A Purchase Begins
During a live session, the influencer promotes a single product. A fan watching the stream decides to buy it—not by visiting a website, but by messaging a WhatsApp bot. The bot collects a few key details—address, payment info, agreement to terms—and completes the order.

Alternatively, someone might visit the site like a normal user, browse, and purchase that way.

In both cases, the system is interacting with data: through web forms or through APIs called by the bot. These are different interfaces, but the same goal: capturing domain data.

## Step 3: Transformation – Discounts and Deliveries
When the user is about to pay, the final price might change. A promotional code could apply a discount. Delivery costs are calculated based on their address and the closest warehouse. These values aren’t static—they depend on business rules, sometimes even AI logic.

There are static promotions like “10% off on Sundays,” but also dynamic promotions that evaluate purchase history and suggest personalized discounts to convert the sale while maintaining a healthy profit margin.

These are examples of data transformation. We take raw inputs—date, user profile, purchase history—and generate new values: discounts, delivery fees. These outputs are also part of the domain and need to be stored.

## Step 4: Communication – The Order Is Paid
The order is confirmed and paid—great! But this isn’t the end. A paid order triggers multiple things:

- It tells the Delivery Module to start logistics.
- It tells the Revenue Sharing Module to calculate the influencer’s earnings.

This is data communication. A change in one part of the system sends events to other parts. These communications are asynchronous: each module listens and reacts independently.

## Step 5: Orchestration – Something Goes Wrong
Oops—delivery fails. The product comes back. This means we have to cancel the order.

Unlike earlier steps, this one needs strict orchestration. The steps have to happen in sequence, and each depends on the previous one finishing correctly:

1. Logistics team processes the return.
2. The returned item is added back to inventory.
3. The Payments Module issues a refund.
4. The Revenue Sharing Module subtracts the fee from the influencer’s balance.

This chain of events must be coordinated carefully. We can’t refund before receiving the item. This is where orchestration matters: tightly controlled data flows, step by step.

## Why This Architecture Works
At every point in the user journey, different modules serve a different role:

| Function     | Purpose                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Represent    | Store and display domain data (influencers, products)     |
| Interact     | Capture or retrieve data (forms, bots, APIs)              |
| Transform    | Apply business rules to generate new data                 |
| Communicate  | Notify other modules through events                       |
| Orchestrate  | Coordinate steps in a fixed sequence                      |

Knowing which part of the platform does what is key. Not all data is equal. Some data belongs to the domain (like product prices or influencer profiles), others are temporary or technical (like the specific payload needed by PayPal—those are DTOs, not part of the domain).

## Final Thoughts
If you understand the business deeply and model it correctly, you’re already applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD). That means your database and your modules are built around the real structure of the business—not just around technical shortcuts.

Then, if you take the time to classify your classes based on what they do with data—whether they represent, interact, transform, communicate, or orchestrate—you’re organizing your logic into clear responsibilities, which brings you closer to Clean Architecture. In Clean Architecture, each layer has its job, and communication between them flows in one direction—from the outside in.

Finally, if each module is independent, testable, and follows good design principles, you’re applying SOLID principles. That means your code is flexible, easier to maintain, and ready to grow without becoming a mess.

So even if you’re not using buzzwords or frameworks directly, by designing your system around the truth of the business and being intentional about how data flows—you’re already doing things the right way. You’re building a system that’s not just functional, but resilient, meaningful, and built to last.
